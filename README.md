# Proxy

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

This project uses an angular 2 interface along with a nodejs server to create a dynamic proxy.
This project is intended to be used with mobiles where you want to point all phones to 1 proxy and then have that proxy forward the requests to the developers machine as requested.

## Development server

Run `npm run grunt` and `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
This application has been made in Visual Studio Code and as such it has not been tested with any other development environments.
